XMega-boards
============

Breakouts for various XMegas with required supporting hardware

## Boards

  - Xmega32A4U: The first test board, works fine but the regulator used
    is no longer stocked by digikey/mouser so next rev will see a different
    one. You can still use a TO-92 regulator though.
  - Heikki is working on a board for the 100pin chips, keep watching this space.
